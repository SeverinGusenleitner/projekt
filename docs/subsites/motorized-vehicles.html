        <h2>When It’s Worth Using Motorized Vehicles</h2>
        <p>Motorized vehicles are most practical for short to medium distances, or where public transport is limited:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Trips between towns or within rural areas</li>
            <li>Traveling with luggage, family, or multiple passengers</li>
            <li>When flexibility and personal schedule are priorities</li>
            <li>Situations where speed is moderate, and airports or train stations are inconvenient</li>
        </ul>
